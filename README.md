# Random-Encounter
A game inspired by DumpsteR_PlayeR2's Capture game. It has been modified to work as a DnD system within Twitch chat. The end goal is for users to be able to have random encounters, find loot, equip their warrior however they would like, and to go on quests with other members of chat for epic loot.
